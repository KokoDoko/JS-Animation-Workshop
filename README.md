# Javascript Animation Workshop
Files for a short javascript animation workshop. 

In this workshop, we use the [**Greensock**](https://www.greensock.com) animation library to create a simple
responsive animation, showing a racetrack with racing karts.

The karts start moving randomly after pressing the start button.
The winning kart receives a 1-up, shown by a little animation.

The karts leave the track and enter again in a nice stagger animation.
